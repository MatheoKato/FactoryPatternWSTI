# FactoryPatternWSTI
Task for passing the course Multi-layer systems

  As part of the task, you should prepare a simple CLI application. In our application we want
have several tools whose behavior will be adapted to the selected system
operational.
The first tool we should add will be a manager that allows you to
interaction with the file system. It should allow the following operations:
  - file creation
  - file deletion
  - creating a folder
  - delete folder
 
  Assumptions
1. The problem must be solved using the Abstract Factory pattern.
2. For simplicity, we can assume that the user provides the selected operating system
at program start.
3. The file manager does not have to actually perform operations in the system. It will be enough
write commands to the console.
